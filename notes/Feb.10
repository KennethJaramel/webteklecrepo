Eight Methods
1. GET-retrieved
  >transfer a current selected presentation of the resource identified bynthe Request
  >the retrieved resource returned in the message body of the response as an entity
  >most commonly used in HTTP method
2. HEAD
  >same as Get,except that the entity is not included in the response
  >used to retrieve metadata about the entity implied by the request without transferring
    the entity itself
3. POST
   >submit data to server
   >perform resource- specific processing of the entities enclosed
4. PUT
+  >Store the enclosed entity in the messagebody under the specified request.
+  >Allows to upload some to to the web.
5. OPTIONS
+  >Querying the server on what you can do to the resource.

6. TRACE
+  >Used to request a loopback of the request message.
+  >Typically used for testing/diagnostics of the request response chain.

7. CONNECT
+  >Used for HTTPS.
+  >Also used for establishing a tunnel.

8. SAFE METHOD
+  >Doesn't make any changes on the resources.
+  >i.e(get,head,options,trace)

+IDEMPOTENT METHOD
+  >The result/response will not change even if we call it several times.
+  >i.e(put,delete,options,trace,get,head)
+  >Post is not an idempotent method because you can only use it once.

+CACHEABLE METHOD
+  >local storage
+  >response if its cacheable or not
