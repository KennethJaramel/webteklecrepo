HTTP
  >application layer communications protocol used to access resources (hypertext/hypermedia)
   on the World Wide Web
  >invented by Tim Berners-Lee
  >jointly developed by the W3C and IETF(Internet Engineering Task Force)
  >version history:
	HTTP 0.9 (1991)
	HTTP 1.0 (RFC 1945, May 1996)
	HTTP 1.1 (RFC 2068 Jan 1997, RFC 2616 Jun 1999),
	RFC 7230-7235(Jun 2014)
	HTTP 2 (RFC 7540 May 2015)
  >HTTP runs on top of TCP/IP, using TCP port 80 by default, or TCP port 443 for HTTPS
   (HTTP over SSL/TLS)
  >HTTP is based on a client-server architecture
     -clients, a.k.a. user agents(UA)
	-web browsers, web crawlers/spiders, other end user tools & application
HTTPS
  -provides encrypted pannel
  -secure channel
Servers:
  -origin servers
  -proxy servers, gateways, tunnels
HTTP uses a request-response standard protocol
  -the client sends an HTTP request message to the server
  -the server processes the request and replies with an HTTP response message
HTTP is a stateless communications protocol
  -servers do not keep information about clients in-between request
HTTP provides support for other functionalities, such as:
  >cache control
  >content media type (MIME) specification
  >language and character specification(ASCII)
  >content/transfer codings
  >client-server protocol negotiations
  >persistent connection
  >request pipelining
  >authentication/authorization
